Theory:
Linear convolution is a mathematical operation used to combine two signals to produce 
a third signal. It's a fundamental operation in signal processing and systems theory.
Mathematical Definition: 
Given two signals, x(t) and h(t), their linear convolution is defined as: 
 y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫ 𝐱(𝛕)𝐡(𝐭−𝛕) 𝐝𝛕
 
Applications: 
Filtering: Convolution is used to filter signals, removing unwanted frequencies 
or noise. 
System Analysis: The impulse response of a system completely characterizes its 
behaviour, and convolution can be used to determine the output of the system 
given a known input. 
Image Processing: Convolution is used for tasks like edge detection, blurring, 
and sharpening images.
